# Natural Language Processing for Text Classification with NLTK and Scikit-learn
#### Johnson Amodu
In the project, Getting Started I used Natural Language Processing to carryout tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, stemming, chunking, and named entity recognition. Furthermore, I dove into machine learning and text classification using a simple support vector classifier and a dataset of positive and negative movie reviews.

In this project, I will expand on the following foundatiosn and explore different ways to improve our text classification results. We will cover and use:

<ul>
<li>Regular Expressions
<li>Feature Engineering
<li>Multiple scikit-learn Classifiers
<li>Ensemble Methods
<li>Model Evaluation
</ul>
